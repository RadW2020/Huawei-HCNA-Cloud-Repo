#### Cloud Computing Concepts and Values
Key characteristics of cloud computing are On-demand self-service, Location-independent resource pool (ubiquitous network access over the Internet), Pay per use, Elasticity.


Cloud computing is a Computing/Storage Network. It includes devices for data processing (servers), data storage and data communications (switches); and services for virtualization, scheduling and management, and the providing platform.

Other characteristics are low-cost servers, distributed software and automatic management.

Cloud computing is an integration of grid computing, distributed computing, parallel computing, network storage technologies, virtualization, load balancing, and other
traditional computer and network technologies.

Deployment methods: private (organizations), public (telecom carrier), community (shared infraestructure) and hybrid cloud.
